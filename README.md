# How to install / set up locally

1. Install `poetry`,  the dependency manager we're using, [by following the instructions here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

2. Use `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment (see [the poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for more info)

3. Build the docs site with `mkdocs build`; serve it (with live-reloading) via `mkdocs serve`
