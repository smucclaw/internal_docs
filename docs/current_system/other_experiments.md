# Other experiments

A handful of other work done over the years, may be useful to future development.

* Joe's [https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-lp](https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-lp)

> This project formalises a semantics for L4, a legal DSL for the law, and implements a rule engine execution pipeline, along with various language binding libraries for interacting with L4 and the pipeline. Among these is a browser JS ESM library which is used to implement an IDE that parses, transpiles and executes L4, as well as visualise execution traces completely in the browser.
