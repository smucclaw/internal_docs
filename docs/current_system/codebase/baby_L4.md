# Baby L4 -- a precursor to Natural L4

In 2020/2021, first came the BNFC-based L4 <https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl/tree/main/bnfc>

In 2021/2022, we tried to separate out a core language. We called it core-l4, or baby-l4. That effort is recorded at <https://github.com/smucclaw/baby-l4>

In 2022/2023, we brought up the [natural4](https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl/tree/main/lib/haskell/natural4) toolchain.

In 2024 we started thinking about going back to basics with a BNF-based grammar again.
