# Notes on the Codebase

TODO: YM thinks that it would be better to briefly summarize on this page, at a high level, what these major projects are and how they relate to each other to form a hopefully cohesive whole. But if Meng prefers to just dump links, YM will defer to Meng on this.

Our codebase is split across multiple repos, and even within the `dsl` repo, across multiple `stack` projects under `lib/haskell/`.

The major projects are:

- [anyall](./anyall.md)
- [explainable](./explainable.md); discussion of 'MathLang' is also housed here
- [natural4](./natural4.md)

We also talk about

- [visualizations](./visualizations.md)
