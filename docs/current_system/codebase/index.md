# Notes on the Codebase

Our codebase is split across multiple repos, and even within the `dsl` repo, across multiple `stack` projects under `lib/haskell/`.

The major projects are:
- [anyall](./anyall.md)
- [explainable](./explainable.md)
- [natural4](./natural4.md)

We also talk about
- [visualizations](./visualizations.md)
