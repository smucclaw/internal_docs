# Welcome!

It's still in a pretty rough state, but hopefully it's enough to be helpful.

## How to read this

Start with the [Historical Context](./historical_context.md), which links to the original grant proposal. (If you don't have access to our Google Drive, ask one of us for the proposal, or ask Meng for access to it).

Then read [this overview of the current L4 system](./current_system/index.md). From there, it should be clear what to look at to get more information about the specific components of the system.


## MkDocs Commands, just in case

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
