# Welcome!

It's still in a pretty rough state, but hopefully it's enough to be helpful.

## How to read this

Start with the [Historical Context](./historical_context.md), which links to the original grant proposal. (If you don't have access to our Google Drive, ask one of us for the proposal, or ask Meng for access to it).

Then read [this overview of the current L4 system](./current_system/index.md). From there, it should be clear what to look at to get more information about the specific components of the system.

Other noteworthy things include:

* a more detailed, but currently still WIP, discussion of the codebase [in the Codebase section](./current_system/codebase/index.md).
* [an annotated bibliography in 'Further Reading'](./further_reading.md); this will be helpful for getting broader background on computational law and legal DSLs.

## On contributing

If you are writing something that involves explaining things, it'd probably be a good idea to get someone to at least skim it (i.e., 'code' review).
